# Cucumber Full Language Support
VSCode Cucumber (Gherkin) Language Support + Format + Steps/PageObjects Autocomplete Enhanced for Behat
* This version is a modified one from the original plugin for Behat users (credits to the author of the plugin, Alexander Krechik)

## This extension adds rich language support for the Cucumber (Gherkin) language to VS Code, including:
* Syntax highlight
* Basic Snippets support
* Auto-parsing of feature steps from pathes, provided in settings.json
* Autocompletion of steps
* Ontype validation for all the steps
* Definitions support for all the steps parts
* Document format support, including tables formatting
* Supporting of many spoken languages
* Gherking page objects native support

## Important extension goals are improving of steps suggestions list and minimization of user edits after step inserting:
* Sort steps suggestions by their using count
* Option to filter steps completions depending on words used for their defining
* Option to automatically change all the steps parts, that require some user action, by snippets
* Option to show several different completion variants for steps with 'or' RegEx parts (like `(a|b)`)

## How to use:
1. Open your app in vscode
2. Install cucumberautocomplete extension
3. In the opened app root create (if absent) .vscode folder with settings.json file or just run ```mkdir .vscode && touch .vscode/settings.json```
4. Add all the needed settings to the settings.json file
5. Reload app to apply all the extension changes
6. To get autocomplete working, `strings` var of `editor.quickSuggestions` setting should be set to true (because by default `string` suggestions will not appear)
